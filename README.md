## Description

Visual media are increasingly generated, manipulated, and transmitted by
computers. When well designed, such displays capitalize on human facilities for
processing visual information and thereby improve comprehension, memory,
inference, and decision making. Yet the digital tools for transforming data
into visualizations still require low-level interaction by skilled human
designers. As a result, producing effective visualizations can take hours or
days and consume considerable human effort.
